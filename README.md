# Weather Modeling and MLflow Experimentation

This project analyzes London weather data, visualizes trends, and uses regression models to predict mean temperature. It logs experiments using MLflow for tracking performance.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
- Data Preprocessing (Imputation, Scaling)
- Linear, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressors
- RMSE evaluation and MLflow logging

## Dataset

This project uses a CSV file named `london_weather.csv` with the following features:
- Date (YYYYMMDD)
- Weather metrics such as temperature, precipitation, sunshine, etc.

## Getting Started

### Installation
